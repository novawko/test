            <div class="pl-4">
                <p><b><u>Scientific Classification:</u></b>
				<ul>
				<li><b>Kingdom:</b> Animalia</li>
				<li><b>Phylum:</b> Chordata</li>
				<li><b>Class:</b> Mammalia</li>
				<li><b>Infraclass:</b> Allotheria</li>
				<li><b>Order:</b> Chordonti</li>
				<li><b>Family:</b> Kanpidae</li>
				<li><b>Genus:</b> Kanpo</li>
				<li><b>Species:</b> Kanpolo</li>
				<li><b>Binomial Name:</b> Kanpo squinini</li>
				</ul>
                Kanpolos are a semi-aquatic species native to Jovalan, they have 2 subspecies, Freshwater Kanpolos and Deep Sea Kanpolos. They all live in the ocean or around water and love to make their homes out of brightly coloured things. Like coral, which is the main thing they build their homes out of. They live in colonies and are normally lead by one Kanpolo who starts the colony from scratch on their own until other Kanpolos move in.</p>
            </div>
			
			<h2 class="text-primary mt-3 mb-3">Lifestyle & Behavior</h2>
			<div class="pl-4">
                <p>Kanpolos live underwater in the sea usually on the sea floor. They can breath underwater and land no problem, though they can die if you cover the parts where they breath from. They make their homes out of Coral and usually pick the most colourful ones. They are usually Diurnal but it’s up to you what times of day they are up. They also taste like fish but pretty rich, sort of like prawn. They are hunted by other species, they have natural predators. Which are the ginormous land sharks, called the Bood Shark. They like to camouflage under the sand and wait for the Kanpolo to be close enough, usually during the time when Kanpolo sunbathe. Before bursting out of the sand and snapping them up whole. You can tell that they totally fear the Bood Shark, imagine being a human on Jovalan, you'd basically be an ant compared to it. They are also hunted by alien species called the Cracke-D which are a cephalopod-like species that has a appetite for their rich meat.</p>

                <p>Kanpolos are more vulnerable on land, due to being a bit more slower on land than on water, due to the hunting and predators. They are naturally anxious on land, so if you approach them they will mostly scream/screech and go on the defensive almost like a cat, but would run away if it had the chance. They also can speak, but they usually talk once they’ve warmed up to you. In the sea they usually mimic sounds, like whale calls. They usually do whale calls/noises, they also make a bubbly purr sometimes, usually when happy or just whenever they feel like it.</p>

                <p>Kanpolos also can be a bit (or more) defensive of their (lover) partner, usually the male Kanpolo’s are but females can be too.</p>
            </div>
			
			<h2 class="text-primary mt-3 mb-3">Gestation Period</h2>
			<div class="pl-4">
                <p>Starting with the gestation period of a Kanpolo: They start in the womb like a mammal their gestation period is about 14 months or more. The womb sac is inside the mother Kanpolos pelvis area, and expands out from the pelvis area as the gestation period goes, usually bigger if the Kanpolo is carrying more than 3. Because the Kanpolo can carry about 5 babies in their womb.</p>
				<p>The embryo start as the size of a kidney bean (6mm), in a small fertilised fish like egg, the egg does not have a outer shell it’s almost like a slimy ball. By 10 weeks the embryo is a foetus (Month 3) and it is very visible inside the egg, the egg would be the size of a medium average chicken egg. (40.61mm). By 20 weeks (Month 5) the mother Kanpolo is in their First Trimester, the foetus being the size of a goose egg at this time. (3 inches). By (Month 9) the mother is in their Second Trimester, the foetus is the size of a average human baby.</p>
				<p>(19 inches), they lay an egg, which the foetus is inside. When the egg comes out it has no outer shell and has a sac around the outside of it, of course it’s see through and fragile. But to protect it the sac helps the egg float down onto the sea floor so when it touches the sea floor it won’t be damaged. The sac around it protects it by releasing out fluid slowly. The outside of the egg which was protected by the sac after a while becomes a outer shell, which is hard to protect the foetus inside. By the 14th month the egg hatches and a little baby Kanpolo cub climbs out and is the size of a elephant calf (1 metre). Sometimes they are born sometime after the 14th month, but if they are born before the 14th month it’s usually something to be concerned about. But they are usually fine. When they are fully grown, they are the height of a fully grown elephant, or taller depending on the Kanpolo.</p>
            </div>
			
			<h2 class="text-primary mt-3 mb-3">Beliefs</h2>
			<div class="pl-4">
                <p>Kanpolos have a religion called Kutumuk, where they believe when they pass away, they become a eel creature based on a real eel species found on their planet. That has crystallised coral on its back, it's basically a god like creature, though they haven't been proven to exist, the real eels themselves look a bit different than their religion depicts. They call the crystallised eel, Kiutu(s).</p>
				<p>Kanpolos when they see their kind ill, they'd think 'Oh, this is probably some common cold and they'll get over it'. 'No problem'. Kanpolos haven't learnt about germ theory or have scientifically proven medical treatment methods. As they do not have science or scientists, as they haven't exactly 'discovered' it. They usually let their wounds treat themselves or attempt to experiment with plants or herbs found around the ocean, like seaweed for example. They believe seaweed can treat infected wounds.</p>
				<p>Kanpolos do not have technology and would be considered 'behind' compared to humans. They mainly use rocks as tools and build their homes out of corals, live in burrows they create and keep held up using coral as pillars or sandstone, etc. They can be described as 'tribal' or 'primitive', (not in a discriminatory way of course), they are very smart, it just takes time to learn new things. They call bullets 'arrows' and if you showed them a X'ray they'd most likely be scared of it as they are scared of new things and take some convincing or time to warm up to it.</p>
				<p>Kanpolos prefer to go by their names instead of using pronouns, for example they rarely ever use She/He/Them. As gender isn't really something they care about usually, as they believe their names make them, them, not their gender. Kanpolos do not know of/have any other gender terms beside Female/Male, but they are generally neutral about gender in general.</p>
            </div>
			
			<h2 class="text-primary mt-3 mb-3">Anatomy</h2>
			<div class="pl-4">
                <p>Their teeth are sharp, their upper canines being unique looking, having the main part being a long sharp thick needle while the two shorter parts and still a bit long but not really needle-like, just sharp and pointy. so they can catch fish easier in their mouth. Their teeth can pierce flesh easily and rarely use it on when defending themselves, mostly preferring to be gentle and passive.</p>
				<p>They are Omnivores but they do prefer to eat sea creatures that they can fit in their mouth, or eat anything that is dead already no matter the size. They do eat the sea flora. Their skin is very slippery to the touch, so it’s hard to hold them or grip onto them. The only parts that aren’t really like that are their doe clawed feet which are webbed, their horns. (Unless the horns are coral, then they might have slippery horns IF the coral is wet), or their tail which is hard like a prawns tail on the outside.</p>
				<p>Their prawn tails have about 14 'segments' or whatever you call their big scaley parts on their tail usually.</p>
            </div>
			
			<h2 class="text-primary mt-3 mb-3">Language</h2>
			<div class="pl-4">
                <p>Kanpolo have been known to write on the walls of their homes, caves, wherever they happen to stay. A lot of the time telling stories, maybe a message for help or just a way to tell who was there. It’s sort of like marking territory for them sometimes too. But it’s usually to write their names alongside their relatives, sort of like a family tree in a way. It keeps track of the generations, you could say.</p>
				<p>Kanpolo have also been known to share their language with the Woobar, who also speak and write in their language, though they may pronounce things differently than them. This is mainly due to generations of trading and communication between the species.</p>

                Cracke’Ds are a alien species, who come from a heavily polluted planet which had a mass extinction. Leaving only the Cracke left since they had adapted to the horrible pollution long before it happened. They are a poor species, as they constantly struggle back on their home planet for food. So they travel through space to hunt for food on other planets, rich fish-like foods are their favourite and the most nutritious for them. So when they found the Kanpolo, they automatically got a taste for them.</p>

Though, they have decided they are no longer are interested in the species and have given them to Cancri to take care of. Kumiyaas for now on will be available here and will be worked on before becoming available to the public to make!</p>

               <p>Kumiyaas were created by mixing three random species, which were sort of picked by a animal generator, in the end Wilbur had picked… Cougar, Snow Owl and Axolotl as the main animals they wanted them based on! The Kumiyaa are mainly a water-dwelling species, which is perfect for Jovalan of course! Though they may stick close to land masses more often than the Kanpolo.</p>

               <p>They have padded bird feet, a axolotl tail with a sail going up to the back of their head, feathered forearms and webbed, padded paws with retractable claws! They also have the little frills/gills that axolotls have on their neck and two little feathers on their head! With sharp spaced teeth and canines used for catching prey! They’re insectivorous and sometimes eat sea foliage!</p>

				Burgvoirs are a aquatic species native to Jovalan, they live on their nests that are basically little ships that float across the ocean surface. Unlike Kanpolos they are solitary, when it’s mating season they glide across the ocean to islands where they meet. They will then return to the ocean to lay their eggs in their nests where they will rear their young in their nests until they’re ready to survive on their own.</p>

				The Liz’ae are a lizard-like humanoid species. Most of them live on a completely artificial planet, since their homeworld was destroyed, but some small colonies are still scattered across the galaxy. Liz’ae look like humans, but with scales scattered across their bodies, lizard tails, and antennae that assist their sense of smell. They are most often calm and non-confrontational by nature, with a big cultural emphasis on family and community, although there are exceptions to every rule. They are very accepting of new creatures and visitors.</p>
            </div>
			
			<h2 class="text-primary mt-3 mb-3">Governmemt & Economy</h2>
			<div class="pl-4">
                <p>The Liz’ae’s current government is a Republic, meaning that no one is above the law. Absolute power is not held by any one person or group. The federal government is very small, for the most part just handling the national military and foreign affairs. In order for the president to make a law or policy that extends over all the sectors, the vast majority of the senators have to vote in favor of it.</p>

                <p>The Liz’ae are given great freedom to do whatever they want with their money inside the law and taxes are very low. This being said, welfare programs and free healthcare are either very small or nonexistent in most sectors, so taking care of poor Liz’ae is mostly funded by charities that the people put together instead of the government. It has proved highly effective, as the Liz’ae are a fairly generous people.</p>

                <p>At the head of the federal government is the president. His powers are limited by the senate. Elections for that office are held once every five years. The Liz’ae are very prosperous and their planet is generally regarded as a good place to invest. They import goods just as fast as they export goods. Their government generally doesn’t give loans to other planets that are in trouble. Instead, they encourage the citizens to donate to relief projects that they send. Federal money is rarely used unless the need is very urgent.</p>

			<h2 class="text-primary mt-3">History</h2>
			<div class="pl-4">
                <p>
				<ul>
				<li>(542 - 300ish BD - Before Destruction) • Their world lived in peace for the first three hundred years before being discovered by an outside species.</li>
				<li>(300ish - 1 BD) • After that, they did their best to keep up with the rest of the galaxy and defend themselves.</li>
				<li>(1 - 34 AD - After Destruction) • But they were eventually overcome by another species and their homeworld was destroyed. A small percentage who were either already offworld or were saved by a different alien species were taken elsewhere and hidden. They lived without a homeworld for several decades.</li>
				<li>(34 - 54 AD) • A completely artificial planet is built over the course of twenty years as the Liz’ae thrive on other planets but want a place to form a central government.</li>
				<li>(54 - 56 AD) • A small amount of Liz’ae move to the new planet in order to make it safe and liveable. Most do not move, as they have already established themselves on other planets and are thriving there.</li>
				<li>(56 AD) • They make a central government and grant all Liz’ae automatic citizenship in order to encourage more of their kind to move there. A mass migration occurs as close to 90% of all the other Liz’ae make the decision to establish themselves there.</li>
				<li>(56 AD) • There is a housing and job crisis with the mass migration, which eventually burns itself out.</li>
				<li>(57 - 60 AD) • The Liz’ae firmly establish themselves on their new planet and begin importing and exporting goods. Their economy thrives.</li>
				<li>(65 AD) Slavery is abolished, along with drugs used for non-medical purposes. There is some protestation but is quickly tamped down. Black markets to distribute them start to spring up.</li>
				<li>(78 AD) • The Liz’ae make their own military because of people attacking their trade ships. They also establish a more effective police force. Crime rates on planet and off planet go down.</li>
				<li>(82 AD) • the planet becomes fully occupied, making the population density go up in the less inhabited areas. Privately owned gardens and livestock get more valuable.</li>
				<li>(107 AD) • Non-Liz’ae off worlders start going to their planet more and more. Immigration plans are put into place to give non-Liz’ae’s citizenship.</li>
				<li>(125 AD) • The Liz’ae successfully repel an invasion in a single day. The government declares it a national holiday.</li>
				<li>(Present Day) • The Liz’ae have gradually become more and more interested in offworld careers, and their planet is a thriving metropolis with a very good economy.</li>
				</ul>

            </div>
			
			<h2 class="text-primary mb-3">Main World</h2>
			<div class="pl-4">
                <p>The Liz’ae’s new world is almost completely city. The livestock and crops are highly valuable and grown in artificial environments that allow them to be grown as naturally as possible. Of course, the quality will never be as good as it once was since the original planet got destroyed. There are fifteen “sectors” that the Liz’ae live in. Each has its own governor and policing system.</p>

                <p>The capital is called Velfar and sometimes the planet is called that as well, although people call it both Velfar and just Liz’ae. Each sector has its own capital as well, and tend to compete with each other a little bit for tourism and things like that. They also each have slightly different laws, as each sector is given a lot of individual freedom.</p>

                <p>One landmark is the tallest building on the planet, often called the Melar Tower after the Liz’ae who designed it. Another is the largest artificial garden on the planet. It features ponds, a small forest, and lots of flora and fauna that grow wild. It requires a lot of care and a large staff but still remains one of the most popular places to visit for both onworlders and offworlders. The only downside is that it also allows parasites to grow with the rest of the things there, and Liz’ae who visit are heavily advised to schedule a checkup with a doctor afterwards.</p>

               <p>Most diseases that plague the Liz’ae are ones that affect their gills, scales/skin, mouth, stomach, ears, and eyes. They can be especially prone to disease when they are stressed, and some diseases are only able to take hold when the host is stressed. Otherwise, they can lay dormant in the liz’ae’s body and infect others. For this reason, liz’aes have regular checkups to insure that they are not unknowingly spreading a disease or parasite.</p>
            </div>
			
			<h2 class="text-primary mt-3 mb-3">Family & Reproduction</h2>
			<div class="pl-4">
                <p>Liz’ae have a very family-centered community and are very focused on making connections with others. They are very social and connected with their neighbors. A family typically consists of two parents and more than one child. Large families are very common, and it is not uncommon for Liz’ae children to have around three or four siblings. Children being adopted out is very very rare, so most stay with their biological parents.</p>

                <p>Divorce is very uncommon in the Liz’ae community, with two Liz’ae often being together until one of them dies. If one dies and the other is still young, it is common for them to get married again after the grief lessens. Female Liz’ae keep a fertilized egg inside them for up to two weeks, then lay them in a pool of water so that they are completely submerged. The egg is normally fairly small, unless it is a twin egg. Eggs with twins or more are very very rare. The eggs take about two months to hatch. If they hatch earlier because something is wrong with the egg, it can be a problem for the child, but this is rare.</p>
            </div>
			
			<h2 class="text-primary mt-3 mb-3">Education</h2>
			<div class="pl-4">
                <p>All Liz’ae are homeschooled through ten grades (plus preschool and kindergarten), starting preschool at age three and ending homeschool at age sixteen. The program is government-approved and teaches both the “hard sciences” as well as the fine arts. Every Liz’ae (unless excused by some mental or physical disability,) takes at least one sport for the purpose of doing team-building exercises and physical development, but this is just a tradition, not required by law. Most Liz’ae also choose to learn an instrument, sometimes more than one. This includes singing and choir. This is also a tradition not required by law.</p>

                <p>After finishing grade ten, a Liz’ae can choose to specialize in a particular field by either going to a college or finding a mentor. Mentors are widely popular but not all Liz’ae can find or afford one. Colleges are usually the more economic option. Mentors are usually very old and well-established in their field. To become a mentor, one has to take an incredibly difficult test that has both questions to be answered and hands-on work. Most Liz’ae are not able to pass the tests but are still able to teach at a college. The Liz’ae education system has proved to be sufficiently effective.</p>
            </div>
			
			<h2 class="text-primary mt-3 mb-3">Holidays & Calendar</h2>
			<div class="pl-4">
                <p>The Liz’ae calendar has 365 days and 12 months (with one leap day), like our calendar. For simplicity’s sake, we are going to label the months as they appear on our calendar instead of giving them new names.</p>
            </div>
			<h3 class="text-primary mt-3">Holidays Connected to Ours</h3>
			<div class="pl-4">
                <p>
				<ul>
				<li>Christmas for the Liz’ae is to celebrate a spirit of fellowship with others, and the connection between friend.</li>
				<li>Thanksgiving for the Liz’ae is to celebrate contentment and being thankful for all that they have, like our Thanksgiving. They simply call it the Day of Thanks.</li>
				<li>New Years could be described as being celebrated almost religiously across the sectors.</li>
				<li>Valentine's Day is called the Festival of Youth, but is celebrated the same way.</li>
				<li>Instead of Easter, they Celebrate the Springtime Festival. This is basically a month-long celebration of the turning of the seasons, even though their new planet does not have seasons any longer.</li>
				<li>Mother’s Day and Father’s Day are also both celebrated on their usual dates and are called the same. Because Liz’ae normally have strong family ties, they are larger events than on earth.</li>
				<li>Leap day is celebrated like April Fools’ day here. They do not have an April Fools’ day on April 1st.</li>

			<div class="pl-4">
                <p>The different sectors on their planet do not have individual names, and are simply called “sector one,” “sector two,” etc. Each sector has its own “prime city,” which basically means that it's the capital of the sector. They are the largest cities in their sectors and also usually have the most offworld visitors. Velfar, the capital of their nation, is where the federal government is situated and has little to do with the individual sector’s governments. Each sector has its own specialty, and sectors can sometimes be competitive when it comes to making money and attracting tourists.</p>

				Bood Sharks, also known as the “Land Shark” are a terrestrial predator, though they have been found in the water at the shores to cool off or get hydrated. They’re the primary and natural predator of the Kanpolo, Kanpolo are slower on land than they are in water, while the Bood Shark is faster on land. Bood Shark have been found to camouflage on the beaches, burying themselves into the sand and changing colour to blend in.</p>

                <p>Whilst the keratin growths on their backs mimic rocks. They’re somewhat like octopuses or chameleons with how they change colour and usually only change colour for predation purposes. They always change back to what they originally looked like when coming out of hiding. Bood Sharks are solitary creatures and are always found alone, unless it’s mating season, when they all meet at the shore. Males will fight to show their dominance, sort of like how walruses do on Earth. In order to get as many girls possible to mate. Bood Sharks are probably about 3-5x larger than a Kanpolo and can easily swallow them whole in one go.</p>

				Tech-Alipos, are a bat-like cyborg species! Known for their enormous oversized wings and gas-masked face! Ruled by a single warmonger Alipo, called Lord Lortharx. They’re a very advanced species that has abandoned almost all biological parts of their body, turning themselves into cyborgs for their overlord. They live in a ginormous ship, which acts as a giant hive for them. Which where their planet of origin they had turn into a lifeless machine orbits it as if it was it’s sun.</p>

                <p>Tech-Alipo are feared by a lot of species, even the powerful Vanguard fear them! They are infamous for mass invasions where’d they would fly past everything so fast in swarms that only a blur could be seen. If flown past you, you could become a pile of bones, as they can instant kill you with how fast they are. Ripping off every single piece of tissue off of your skeleton. They even kill all plants in site, mainly trees as they are the usually the first thing to die. Vanguards can take them on, though, they’re strong enough to even kill a Vanguard. No one knows where they came from, but it is suggested a powerful being created these monstrosities.</p>

            <div class="pl-4">
                <p>Vanguards are celestial beings, born from a sentient blackhole. Though, “Vanguard” is just the family name of the originals, all beings born from a blackhole are known as Vanguards, but called by their last names! They’re known for their double pointed elf ears, that have a black tip with a blue-ish tint, same for their fingers and toes. Unique appearances that either represent their name or what they’re based on and they almost always have pointed fingers, toes and a space-like gas tail. Though not all Vanguards have gas tails, they almost always have horns and can be any size. They always have a humanoid/human form, as they have been known to hang around human-like civilisation. They’re known to breath blue fire that sparkles with stars, which upon impact can turn you into stardust. Killing you almost instantly, though if you’re a Vanguard it’d just burn you like normal fire.</p>

                <p>Vanguards are have them ability to shapeshift, the human form, is one of their transformations! Their true form is a giant dragon, that shows what they really look like! A giant space dragon, pretty much, though they don’t always look like dragons, it’s usually related to a mythological creature, for example; Titan’s true form is a Phoenix. They also have the ability to teleport and each Vanguard has their unique abilities depending on the person. Vanguards have been known to be able to give birth oviparous or viviparous-ly. Meaning they can lay eggs or have a pregnancy similar to humans where they give birth live, it’s completely random wether they do it that way or not.</p>
				
		<p>Vanguards grow at… Strange rates. It’s uhh- complicated, to sum it up for you, they time skip to age up. Vanguards have been known to grow whenever they decide to, skipping ages as if they used a watch and skip forward in time a few years, a decade or more. So you’d have a baby and all of the sudden they’d be a toddler, essentially what they do is that they disappear, go into a pocket dimension that is like a black void and skip time and appear back, but it’s so fast it just looks like they suddenly aged up a few years infront if you. Basically, they watch themselves age up in the pocket dimension, watching what would happen if they aged up slowly like a human, so they gain their personality, their skills they would’ve learned, Etc. So when they pop back it’s like they had experienced those years already, but the people around them haven’t experienced yet, because it hasn’t happened. But they can’t timeskip to age up once they hit adulthood, that’s when things get reallllyyyy slow and they stay young for a good long time, unless their who knows how fat of a lifespan they have gets lower and lower. They can live for millions, trillions or more years. Giving birth to a Vanguard can drain their lifespan, as the baby does take a good portion of their lifespan per child.</p>

				<li><b>Species:</b> Heavian</li>
				<li><b>Binomial Name:</b> Poulitouranou ourakordelas</li>
				</ul>
				Heavians are a bird-like species, known for their large wingspans and long ribbon tails! They’re omnivorous and are commonly found during the summer grazing the ground for sweet things or eating smaller prey. They’re rarely spotted due to being high up in the sky a lot of the time and they usually live in mountain caves. Heavians are prideful but skittish, they know they’re better than you but will flee at the slightest movement. They will only fight of they’re young or there is no escape. Though if you’re lucky, you may find 2-5 of them together in the wild, they’re approachable if you move slow enough, but more likely than not, they will fly off if you get too close. Tame Heavians are known to be loyal to whoever owns them, but are a lot like cats and aren’t afraid of doing what they please. Even against their owners will. Once domesticated they can’t be released, since many wild Heavian’s can smell Kanpolo, or other species, on them and chase them out of their territory.</p>

                <p>They’d have to live solitary and hunt on their own. But most likely than not they’d fly right back to their owner. Heavians are easier to tame when they’re solitary, as Havens have more confidence and security and are more likely to attack or flee when approached. Heavians are good trackers! They can follow a stale scent, which puts their hunting to use, they aren’t resilient hunters though and will stop tracking if it strays too far from the haven or got bored. This is what helps them come back to their owners; memorising by their scent!</p>

                <p>Heavians constantly migrate, making this a part of the reason why they’re barely ever seen. They will settle in the mountains for about 1-3 months during the late fall/winter to lay their eggs and incubate. Their eggs usually incubate at colder temperatures due to how high up Heavians normally are. (Around 40-50 degrees Fahrenheit, 4-10 degrees Celsius). Young Heavians take about a year before they can start flying, so they often cling to their parents feathers and hitch a ride while maturing. Heavians usually leave their haven around 3 years old, but some do choose to stay. Safer in a haven, but may be forced to leave if the haven is too large. Heavians have also been known to prey on Kanpolo children, especially in the winter when they’re hungry. If they’re solitary though and it’s summer, the child will probably just confuse it and approaching with caution. Investigate it and then fly off. If it isn’t hungry, that is. They don’t kill what they can’t eat.</p>

			<h2 class="text-primary mt-3 mb-3">Parenting</h2>
			<div class="pl-4">
                <p>Heavians are liked birds! They would create nests in mountain caves and would let them incubate in the cold, once their chick(s) have hatched. One parent would go out to hunt whilst the other stays with its young and protects them. Domesticated Heavians see Kanpolo children as their own, often bringing them offerings of their side. Either pretty things or just food.</p>

			<h2 class="text-primary mt-3">Trivia</h2>
			<div class="pl-4">
                <p>
				<ul>
				<li>Before Heavians were declared a species, Kanpolos that spotted them would wish upon them, like shooting stars.</li>
                <li>Summer is the optimal time to befriend a Heavian, they tend to graze on food or pick up smaller prey.</li>
                <li>Heavians are very vocal! You may have heard a Heavian cry before, even if distant. They love to try and “talk” with their owner too.</li>
                <li>Haven leaders usually have the longest tail ribbons/feathers or the largest wingspan.</li>
                <li>A group of Heavians are called Havens, they’re normally in havens of 2-5 but it isn’t uncommon to find them solitary.</li>
                <li>Elusive, usually soaring at altitudes that normally can’t be reached.</li>
                <li>They nest in mountain caves, always having two parents present, (like birds; one parent hunts and the other watches over their young. Protecting them).</li>
                <li>Heavians are usually only domesticated by nobles or the rich.</li>
                <li>They’re rumoured to have a low population, due to mostly being hidden so that estimate tends to be lower than it actually is.</li>
                <li>There is a Heavian Breeder known so far in Jovalan, but nobody knows the precise location and are difficult to get ahold of. Best bet is having a noble/rich folk friend to tell you where they may be. Most Kanpolos riding a Heavian probably received it from this breeder. They don’t give out two Heavians of opposing genders, because breeding them makes good money and they don’t want competition.</li>

				Noodle Moths, otherwise known as “Noodle Dragon Moths” are a open species! Which are like those long dragons, but really fluffy and moth-like! Noodle Dragon Moths are primarily found in the Arctic, because of their thick fluffy coats they can handle very cold conditions. But depending on the Noodle Moth, some may not be found in the Arctic. It really depends on their diets, for example; Nalangil is considered Omnivorous, but it prefers to eat flowers. Like a butterfly it uses its long weird sticky tongue to slurp up the pollen or sometimes it straight up eats the whole flower.</p>

                <p>Noodle Moths range from giant to small as a Earth Moth. Noodle Dragon Moths are often called something specific depending on their size, for the smallest size (Earth moth size), they’re called Mini Noodles, Noodle Moths that are about thigh or knee height to a Kanpolo are often called Average Noodles and the big buggers, (Giant size) are often called Giant Noodles. Giant Noodles are big enough to be ridden by a Kanpolo, even a Deep Sea Kanpolo could ride one they’re that big! They’re probably as big as the Cedave or possibly bigger. Average and Mini Noodles are often kept as pets rather than mounts like the Giant Noodles.</p>

                <p>These noodles are what you could consider the “Fairies of Jovalan”, often described as beautiful, elegant and friendly looking, some seem to possess powers, though, those noodles are quite few in number. The most common of the noodles are the minis and are more often found outside the Arctic. The little noodles when found, are often very friendly and can sometimes be seen curiously watching and studying creatures. Especially the Kanpolo, some Kanpolo have recounted that the little critters would sit on their fingers and sit there with their wings opening and closing, as if it was like a little butterfly. Perhaps maybe lick and nibble on their head fins which would tickle and make them giggle. While others have said they felt like the little critters were speaking to them.</p>

                <p>Some recall as cubs that the mini noodles would mischievously play with them and sometimes were led away from their families. Becoming lost, but more often than not would be found with a group of more noodles. The little critters seem to really like children as they were more playful than the adults. There have been a few stories of average or giant noodles attacking Kanpolo or other creatures, though, these aggressive behaviours are quite rare. Most likely they’re from carnivorous noodles.</p>

Woobar are often found alone, as they’re not as social as a species like the Kanpolo and are considered solitary. But sometimes they are found in a group of 5 or 3 if they’re together. Usually they’re a family of Woobar and they aren’t very fond of sharing their territory with other Woobar.</p>
